"""PayBotClientPool — Python port of ``src/client-pool.ts``.

Manage many bots from one operator process while sharing operator-/transport-level
config (API key, facilitator URL, timeout, retries, telemetry) and an optional
shared spend treasury. Each bot keeps its OWN signing context (its own
``wallet_private_key``) and never cross-signs another bot's payments.

The optional shared treasury tracks cumulative spend across ALL bots for the
current UTC day, in memory. Per-bot local counters are a convenience projection
only — they do NOT replace the facilitator's authoritative server-side limits.
